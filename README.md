# Book-management-system

## Overview
This project is a simple Book Management System built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB (via Mongoose), and React. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of books. The frontend is implemented with React for dynamic UI updates, while the backend is powered by Node.js and MongoDB for data storage.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new books with title, author, published date, and genre.
- **Read**: View a list of all books stored in the database.
- **Update**: Edit existing book details.
- **Delete**: Remove books from the database.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Express server handles API routes (`/api/books`) for CRUD operations. MongoDB stores book data using Mongoose models.
- **Frontend**: React client communicates with the backend via Axios for seamless data management.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
